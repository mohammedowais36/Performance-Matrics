# Performance-Matrics
Performance metrics are defined as figures and data representative of an organization's actions, abilities, and overall quality. There are different evaluation metrics in machine learning, and these depend on the type of data and the requirements. Some of the metrics are as follows:
Confusion matrix
Precision
Recall
Accuracy
F1 score
This project involves computing performance metrics parameters (i.e. confusion matrix, F1 score, Accuracy score, AOC Curve, Mean Square Error, and R2 Error) for balanced and unbalanced datasets.
